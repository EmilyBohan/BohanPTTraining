										<h2>The Benefits of Hiring a Personal Trainer</h2>
										<p>There are many benefits of hiring a professional, whether you are an experienced athlete or 
											completely new to fitness. 
										</p>
									</header>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/workoutman.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										Confused on what you should do for workouts? Want to take your fitness to the next level? Training for 
										an event?
										If you have been considering hiring a professional trainer, this article is for you. Here are 5 reasons 
										why it is worth your time and investment to work with a skilled trainer.
									</p>

									<h4>1. Increased accountability and consistency.</h4>
									<p>
										This is number one on the list, for a good reason! We all know those people who love to exercise, and never 
										seem to take a break from their workout routine. That is not most of us. When life gets chaotic, it is easy to 
										let fitness be the first slip when we are focused on other areas of our life. However, exercise has been shown
										to improve the resilience of our immune systems, our minds, and our emotional health. Working with a professional 
										can help keep us on track when the last thing we feel like doing is hitting the gym. Reaching your fitness goals 
										is much less about finding the "hardest" or "best" workout; majority of improving our fitness is about consistently 
										exercising! A good fitness professional will work with you to specifically tailor your fitness plan to your goals, 
										but also to accomodate for all those other life obligations you have. 
									</p>
								
									
									<h4>2. Increased confidence and independence.</h4>
									<p> Many people seek physique changes when hiring a personal trainer. It can be empowering to have clothes fit the 
										way you like, and confidence with your reflection in the mirror. However, one of the most underrated parts of a consistent exercise routine, 
										is the mental benefits. My clients are often pleasantly surprised when they can now lift their 
										carry-on luggage overhead with ease, or climb multiple flights of stairs without a break. Improving our fitness gives us 
										the freedom to make that long walk up to the scenic view on our vacation, or carry that heavy bag of dog food without worrying 
										about our low back. 
									</p>

									<h4>3. Know exactly what you need to do to reach your goals. </h4>
									<p> It can be hard to know what to do when we first start out in the gym. It gets even more confusing when we 
										try to look up workouts on social media! A fitness professional will understand proper exercising programming, dosage, 
										and how to adjust a program according to your specific needs. Have an old injury or surgery? The right fitness 
										professional will be able to adapt a program with this in mind.
									</p>

									<h4>4. Increased energy and happiness to enjoy life.</h4>
									<p>
										In research, exercise has been shown to be just as effective for mild to moderate depression as anti-depressant 
										medication. It is a incredibly powerful tool to help improve our physical well-being, which is directly correlated 
										to our emotional well-being. We have all had those long workdays where the thought of exercising afterwards is 
										dreadful, however moving our bodies helps release dopamine and serotonin, our "feel good" brain chemicals that give 
										us an extra boost in energy. I have had clients who have been able to reduce or stop the dosage of anti-depressants, sleep medications, 
										and NSAIDs with a consistent exercise routine! (Of course, always consult a doctor prior to making medication changes). 
									</p>

									<h4>5. Reduced risk of injury</h4>
									<p>Imagine the maximum amount of weight you can lift is 20 pounds. There are many things in life that weigh at least 
										half this weight, the same, and more. If everytime you lift your new nephew or grandchild who weighs 10 pounds, you are lifting 
										50% of your maximum. If we can increase your strength to be 100 pounds at your maximum, that nephew is now 10% of your 
										max capacity! That significantly reduces your likelihood of injury performing basic daily tasks. </p>
									
									
									

									<h4>6. Prehab instead of rehab. </h4>
									<p>Most of us have experienced the inconvenience of aches and pains that interfere with
									our daily chores, exercise routine, and work duties. Occasionally these pains dissipate 
									on their own, but often they grow into a bigger monster, now preventing us from activities 
									and drain our energy. Pain is exhausting!</p>
									<p>What is prehab? Prehab is getting ahead of an injury or pain before it even starts. Preventative care is 
									significantly more beneficial than reactive care, and we can see that in the heafty toll of medical 
									costs on our health care system today. We have a very "reactive" style of medical care in our country - 
									we address issues such as diabetes, low back pain, and osteoporosis after we start to see the detrimental 
									effects. Prehab focuses on improving the resilience of our bodies, to reduce the likelihood of health 
									issues and pain occuring. Preventative measures are significantly less expensive than reactive care; taking care 
									of your body now, literally pays off.</p>
