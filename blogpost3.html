										<h2>What to Expect from Pelvic Floor Treatment</h2>
										<p>You've decided to move forward in addressing your symptoms. What does the first visit look like?
											How about following treatments? Your questions, answered here. At the end of the blog are common pelvic 
										floor issues addressed by pelvic health specialists.</p>
									</header>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pelvis.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

									<p> Our society does not teach us what is "normal" when it comes to bowel and bladder function. We aren't taught
										about healthy sexual function. We have intuition on how things "should feel down there", but sometimes our pelvic health 
										goes way off track. Possibly you, your partner, or someone you know, pees when they cough, sneeze or jump and state
										"that is just how it is after having a baby and/or getting older". Just because it is common, does NOT mean it is normal! 

									</p>

									<h3>Your First Visit</h3>
									<p>The visit starts with getting to know exactly what you are experiencing. It gives us an idea of what might be happening 
										with your pelvic floor, as well as other muscle groups that are contributing. The nerves of your pelvic floor start in
										your low back and sacral region, coursing through your back, hips and abdominals areas. Function of these other areas of your 
										body can also affect your symptoms. Your provider may look at how your back, hips, spine are moving, as well as your general 
										strength. Additionally, the way we breathe affects our pelvic floor and its function, so often breathing is assessed and discussed. All 
										findings are shared with you. Sometimes it is best to assess pelvic floor directly to see the strength, tone and function 
										of these muscles. If this indicated, your provider will communicate this, and assessment of these muscles is often 
										performed with 1 finger intravaginally. This is always optional and entirely your decision. It is a tool to gather 
										more information to understand exactly what is contributing to your symptoms.
									</p>
										
									<p>
										Based on findings, you will be given a custom home program to do independently with regular visits to check in and 
										change your program as needed. You may be wondering - how often do visits occur? It all depends on your personal 
										needs, budget, and progress. Most clients are seen on a weekly basis to start, and tapered off as symptoms continually improve. 
										If your visit is occurring in person, hands on techniques may be used such as dry needling, myofascial release or trigger point 
										release of abdominals, diaphragm, back or hips if indicated.
									</p>

								

									<h3>Follow-up Visits</h3>
									<p>Follow-up visits will entail discussing how your symptoms are progressing and adjusting your personalized home program 
										as needed. It is a great opportunity to discuss questions in detail. 
									</p>

									<h4>How long will I need treatment?</h4>
									<p>This answer is sometimes hard to predict, but more often than not treatment is 8-12 weeks
										long. The longer you have had symptoms, generally the longer it takes to see results.
										It is a whole new area of the body most of us are very detached from, and it can take time to 
										learn how to control the pelvic floor. Most people begin weekly and as symptoms improve, I spread out visits to make sure the 
										client can maintain and gain progress independently with check-in's to adjust as needed.
									</p>

									<h4>Addressing pelvic floor symptoms with Bohan PT & Training</h4>
									<p>I utilize primarily a virtual format, and so all sessions can be conducted from the comfort of
										your home! Listed below are research articles 
										demonstrating virtual physical therapy is as effective as in-person care. I take a holistic, full 
										body approach in helping people reduce their pelvic symptoms through my online coaching format. 
										If I believe your symptoms need to be addressed in-person, I will help you find a reliable in-person 
										provider, or if you live in my area, we can discuss an in-person option. Click <a href="contactme.html">HERE</a>
										to contact me!
